## 💡 Introduction

Hi, I'm **Kyungbok**, a Frontend Developer driven by precision and user-centric design.

I specialize in **React** and **TypeScript**, focusing on crafting intuitive UIs and scalable frontend architectures that facilitate seamless team collaboration. 

Beyond just "coding a screen," I strive to understand:
- Why a specific component structure is necessary.
- Where the state and responsibility should reside for optimal performance.
- How to write code that is self-explanatory for fellow developers.

> I am evolving into a developer who doesn't just build, but **communicates intent** through every line of code.

## 🎯 What I’m Focusing On

- **Component Design**: Engineering from a UI/UX perspective.
- **Scalability**: Structuring code for reusability and future growth.
- **Real-world Logic**: Implementing features based on actual service flows.
- **Continuous Growth**: Consistent improvement through documentation and retrospection.
